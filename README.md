# Financial Inclusion Prediction Using ANN

#### ⓘ This Project covers:
- Data Cleaning
- Data Preprocessing
- Artificial Neural Network
- HyperParameter Tuning via Keras Tuner

## Introduction
Financial inclusion remains one of the main obstacles to economic and human development in Africa. For example, across Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda only 9.1 million adults (or 14% of adults) have access to or use a commercial bank account.

Traditionally, access to bank accounts has been regarded as an indicator of financial inclusion. Despite the proliferation of mobile money in Africa and the growth of innovative fintech solutions, banks still play a pivotal role in facilitating access to financial services. Access to bank accounts enables households to save and make payments while also helping businesses build up their credit-worthiness and improve their access to loans, insurance, and related services. Therefore, access to bank accounts is an essential contributor to long-term economic growth.

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to create a model to predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account. The models and solutions developed can provide an indication of the state of financial inclusion in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, while providing insights into some of the key factors driving individuals’ financial security.

## Dataset
The dataset contains demographic information and details on what financial services are used by approximately 33,600 individuals across East Africa. This data was extracted from various Finscope surveys ranging from 2016 to 2018. This dataset can be downloaded [here](https://zindi.africa/competitions/financial-inclusion-in-africa/data).

### Features:
1. **Country**: Country interviewee is in.
2. **Year**: Year survey was done.
3. **uniqueid**: Unique Identifier for each interviewee.
4. **Location_type**: Type of location: Rural, Urban.
5. **Cellphone_access**: If interviewee has access to a cellphone: Yes, No.
6. **Household_size**: Number of people living in one house.
7. **Age_of_respondent**: The age of the interviewee.
8. **Gender_of_respondent**: Gender of interviewee: Male, Female.
9. **Marital_status**: The marital status of the interviewee: Married/Living together, Divorced/Separated, Widowed, Single/Never Married, Don't know.
10. **Education_level**: Highest level of education: No formal education, Primary education, Secondary education, Vocational/Specialised training, Tertiary education, Other/Don't know/RTA.
11. **Job_type**: Type of job interviewee has: Farming and Fishing, Self-employed, Formally employed Government, Formally employed Private, Informally employed, Remittance Dependent, Government Dependent, Other Income, No Income, Don't Know/Refuse to answer.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how artificial neural networks can be used to predict financial inclusion. Through data cleaning, preprocessing, and hyperparameter tuning.
